<h1>Cursed Knowledge</h1>

<p>These are some of the things I've learned that have weird behaviour, defy logic and can lead you to insanity.</p>

<p>Inspired by the original concept from the <a href="https://immich.app/cursed-knowledge/">Immich team</a>. If you don't know the project, have a look at it!</p>
